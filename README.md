# Flashcard-Generator

Flashcard Generartor is a basic command-line flashcard application that uses constructor functions to create two types of flashcards.

1. Basic flashcards are displayed with a front (ask a full question e.g. "Who was the first President of the United States?) and back (given answer to question e.g "George Washington").
2. Cloze-Deleted flashcards, which presents a partial text (question that is missing the answer portion) and then displays the full text (answer in full sentence as question) once it is requested or answered by the user. e.g ("..... was the first president of the United States")..flipside ("George Washington was the first President of the the United States.")

The flash cards are built in three parts:
1. Full Text: The entire sentence users need to remember
2. Cloze Deletion: Part of the text that is chosen (by developer) to remove (e.g "George Washington")
3. Partial Text: this is the portion we get if we remove the cloze deletion from the full text

There is a series of 10 random flashcards that will test your memory and mental skills! 

Goodluck & I hope you enjoy it!
